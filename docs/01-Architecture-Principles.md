# Architecture Principles

This document outlines the foundational architectural principles that govern the development of the OTLP Process Metrics Explorer.

## 1. Micro-Component Architecture

The OTLP Process Metrics Explorer follows a micro-component architecture, which promotes:

- **High Cohesion, Low Coupling**: Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility and minimal dependencies.
- **Testability**: Components are designed to be easily testable in isolation.
- **Reusability**: Components can be repurposed or extended for similar use cases.
- **Maintainability**: Small, focused components are easier to understand and modify.

## 2. Separation of Concerns

The system is divided into distinct layers:

- **Data Provider Layer**: Responsible for obtaining OTLP data from various sources.
- **Logic Layer**: Handles data processing, analysis, and transformation.
- **UI Layer**: Presents information to users and manages interactions.
- **Shared Services**: Provides cross-cutting functionality used by multiple components.

## 3. Event-Driven Communication

Components communicate primarily through an event bus, which:

- Decouples components from direct dependencies on each other.
- Allows for flexible system extension without modifying existing code.
- Simplifies the handling of asynchronous operations.

## 4. State Management

A centralized state store serves as the single source of truth for application data:

- All components read from and write to this store.
- State changes trigger UI updates automatically.
- Time-travel debugging is supported for development.

## 5. Performance Optimization

Performance is considered a core feature:

- Computationally intensive tasks are offloaded to Web Workers.
- Lazy loading and virtualization are employed for large datasets.
- Component re-rendering is minimized through memoization and careful state structure.

## 6. Progressive Enhancement

The tool follows a progressive enhancement approach:

- Core functionality works with minimal dependencies.
- Advanced features are added incrementally.
- Users can derive value regardless of their browser capabilities.

## 7. Accessibility First

Accessibility is built into the design from the beginning:

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance is targeted.
- Keyboard navigation is fully supported.
- Screen readers can interpret all visualizations.
- Color schemes account for various forms of color blindness.

## 8. Error Resilience

The system is designed to be resilient to errors:

- Component failures are isolated and do not crash the entire application.
- Error boundaries capture and report issues.
- Fallback UIs are provided when primary views cannot be rendered.
- Comprehensive error states guide users toward resolution.

## 9. Configuration over Convention

Where appropriate, components are configured explicitly rather than relying on implicit conventions:

- Dependencies are injected rather than imported directly.
- Configuration options are documented and validated.
- Sensible defaults are provided for all options.

## 10. Developer Experience

The codebase is optimized for developer productivity:

- Clear documentation is maintained for all components.
- Type safety is enforced through TypeScript.
- Code formatting and linting are automated.
- Tests provide rapid feedback during development.

These principles guide all architectural decisions and should be consulted when designing new components or modifying existing ones.
