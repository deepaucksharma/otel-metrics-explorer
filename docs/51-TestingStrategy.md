# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for the OTLP Process Metrics Explorer, detailing the approach to ensure code quality, functionality, and performance.

## 1. Testing Principles

The OTLP Process Metrics Explorer follows these core testing principles:

- **Test-Driven Development**: Critical components are developed using a TDD approach.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Aim for 80%+ code coverage across all components.
- **Isolation**: Components are tested in isolation to ensure modular functionality.
- **Realistic Data**: Tests use realistic OTLP data to validate real-world scenarios.
- **Automated Quality Gates**: CI/CD pipelines include automated quality checks.

## 2. Test Types

### 2.1 Unit Tests

Purpose: Verify individual functions and components in isolation.

Characteristics:
- Small, focused tests for specific functionality
- Mocked dependencies for true isolation
- Fast execution time
- High coverage of code paths
- Located alongside the code being tested

Technologies:
- Jest (or Vitest) for test runner and assertions
- Testing Library for component tests
- ts-jest for TypeScript support
- jest-dom for DOM assertions

### 2.2 Integration Tests

Purpose: Verify interactions between multiple components.

Characteristics:
- Test interactions between related components
- Limited mocking (only external dependencies)
- Focus on component communication
- Grouped by feature or domain

Technologies:
- Jest for test framework
- Mock Service Worker for API mocking
- Testing Library for component rendering and interaction

### 2.3 End-to-End Tests

Purpose: Validate complete user flows and system behavior.

Characteristics:
- Test full user journeys
- No mocking of internal systems
- Browser-based testing
- Focus on critical paths and business value
- Slower execution, run less frequently

Technologies:
- Playwright or Cypress for browser automation
- Percy for visual regression testing (optional)
- Custom test data fixtures


## 3. Test Organization

### 3.1 Directory Structure

```
/src
  /components
    /MetricCard
      MetricCard.tsx
      MetricCard.test.tsx
      MetricCard.stories.tsx
  /services
    /parser
      OtlpJsonParser.ts
      OtlpJsonParser.test.ts
  /utils
    /formatters
      formatters.ts
      formatters.test.ts
/tests
  /integration
    /features
      metricExploration.test.ts
      cardinalityAnalysis.test.ts
  /e2e
    /journeys
      analyzeSnapshot.spec.ts
      compareSnapshots.spec.ts
  /fixtures
    small.json
    medium.json
    large.json
    highCardinality.json
```

### 3.2 Naming Conventions

- Unit tests: `*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx`
- Integration tests: `*.integration.test.ts`
- E2E tests: `*.spec.ts`
- Test fixtures: Descriptive names reflecting content

## 4. Test Data Strategy

### 4.1 Test Fixtures

- **Small**: Simple OTLP payloads with few metrics (<10)
- **Medium**: Realistic payloads with moderate complexity (10-100 metrics)
- **Large**: Complex payloads with many metrics (>100)
- **Edge Cases**: Payloads designed to test boundary conditions
- **Invalid**: Malformed or invalid data for error handling tests

### 4.2 Data Generation

- Use actual OTLP protobuf/JSON output from instrumented applications
- Create generator scripts for synthetic test data
- Sanitize production data for realistic test scenarios
- Version control fixtures alongside tests

## 5. Mocking Strategy

### 5.1 Dependencies to Mock

- Web Worker communication
- File system interactions
- Network requests
- Browser APIs (when testing in Node.js)
- Time-dependent functions

### 5.2 Mocking Approaches

- **Jest Mocks**: For simple function and module mocking
- **Mock Service Worker**: For API mocking
- **Custom Mock Implementations**: For complex behavior simulation
- **Test Doubles**: For replacing complex dependencies

## 6. Continuous Integration

### 6.1 CI Pipeline Stages

1. **Lint**: Ensure code style and quality standards
2. **Build**: Verify the application builds successfully
3. **Unit Tests**: Run all unit tests
4. **Integration Tests**: Run integration tests
5. **E2E Tests**: Run critical path E2E tests
6. **Deploy**: Deploy to staging or production

### 6.2 Quality Gates

- All tests must pass for promotion to production
- Code coverage must not decrease

## 7. Test Environments

### 7.1 Development Environment

- Local development with hot reloading
- Mocked dependencies for fast testing
- Access to all test fixtures
- Browser-based testing with real rendering

### 7.2 CI Environment

- Headless browsers for UI tests
- Containerized execution for consistency
- Isolated test databases/storage

### 7.3 Stage Environment

- Production-like configuration
- Real services where possible
- Limited test data
- Used for final validation

## 8. Special Testing Considerations

### 8.1 Web Worker Testing

- Mock Worker communication in unit tests
- Use real Workers in integration tests
- Test both with and without Worker support

### 8.2 Large Data Handling

- Test with progressively larger datasets
- Measure memory consumption
- Validate UI responsiveness under load
- Test pagination and virtualization

### 8.3 Visualization Testing

- Visual regression testing for charts and diagrams
- Validation of data accuracy in visualizations
- Testing of interactive visualization features

## 9. Test Documentation

### 9.1 Test Plan

Each major feature should have a test plan documenting:
- Test scenarios and acceptance criteria
- Required test data
- Special testing considerations
- Manual test cases (if applicable)

### 9.2 Test Reports

CI system should generate:
- Test coverage reports
- Visual regression comparisons

## 10. Responsibilities

 - **Developers**: Unit tests and integration tests
- **QA Engineers**: E2E tests, exploratory testing, test planning
- **DevOps**: CI pipeline, test environment maintenance

## 11. Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Core Testing Infrastructure
- Set up testing frameworks and tools
- Create initial test fixtures
- Implement CI pipeline basics
- Establish testing patterns and documentation

### Phase 2: Component Test Coverage
- Develop unit tests for all core components
- Create integration tests for key features

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Test Suite
- Add E2E tests for critical user journeys
- Deploy automated visual regression testing

## 12. Success Metrics

The testing strategy will be considered successful when:
- Code coverage exceeds 80% across the codebase
- All critical user journeys have automated tests
- Release quality issues are reduced by 75% compared to baseline

This testing strategy should be revisited quarterly to ensure it continues to meet the project's evolving needs.
