# Cardinality Analysis View

## Overview

The Cardinality Analysis View is a specialized UI component that visualizes and helps users understand metric cardinality issues. It provides interactive tools for exploring high-cardinality metrics, understanding their impact, and generating recommendations for optimization.

## Responsibilities

1. Visualize metric cardinality across the entire snapshot
2. Identify and highlight high-cardinality metrics and attributes
3. Analyze attribute combinations that contribute to cardinality explosion
4. Estimate storage and computational costs of high-cardinality metrics
5. Generate and present optimization recommendations
6. Provide interactive tools for exploring "what-if" scenarios
7. Export optimization configurations for implementation

## Component Structure

```typescript
interface CardinalityAnalysisViewProps {
  snapshotId: string;
  comparisonSnapshotId?: string;
  initialMetricId?: string;
  costModel?: CostModel;
}

interface CardinalityAnalysisViewState {
  selectedMetricId: string | null;
  selectedAttributes: string[];
  analysisDepth: number;
  costModelParams: CostModelParams;
  viewMode: 'overview' | 'detailed' | 'recommendations';
  sortBy: 'cardinality' | 'impact' | 'name' | 'growth';
  filterValue: string;
}
```

## Visual Design

The Cardinality Analysis View is organized into several interrelated sections:

### Overview Section
- Treemap or sunburst diagram showing relative cardinality of metrics
- Summary statistics (total series, potential reduction, estimated cost)
- Top high-cardinality metrics with impact indicators
- Cost estimation panel with configurable parameters

### Metric Detail Section
- Comprehensive breakdown of a selected metric
- Attribute cardinality contributions visualization
- Interactive attribute combination explorer
- Time series growth projection (if comparison enabled)

### Recommendations Section
- Prioritized list of optimization recommendations
- Implementation guidance with configuration snippets
- Impact preview for each recommendation
- Batch action tools for applying multiple recommendations

## Visualization Strategy

The component uses several specialized visualizations:

- **Cardinality Treemap**: Hierarchical visualization of metric cardinality
- **Attribute Impact Chart**: Stacked bar chart showing cardinality contribution by attribute
- **Combination Matrix**: Interactive matrix showing cardinality of attribute combinations
- **Cost Projection Graph**: Line chart showing estimated cost growth over time
- **Recommendation Impact Chart**: Before/after comparison for recommendations

## Interaction Patterns

- Click on treemap/sunburst sections to focus on specific metrics
- Drag-and-drop attributes to explore different combinations
- Adjustable threshold sliders for highlighting high-cardinality items
- Interactive cost model parameters with real-time updates
- Checkbox selection for batch recommendation actions
- Expandable code snippets for implementation details

## State Management

The component maintains state for:
- User selection and focus elements
- Analysis parameters and thresholds
- Cost model configuration
- Visualization preferences
- Filter and sort criteria

The core cardinality data is sourced from the CardinalityAnalysisEngine via the global state store.

## Accessibility Considerations

- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Screen reader annotations for complex visualizations
- Alternative text-based views for all graphical elements
- High-contrast mode for visualizations
- Focus management for multi-step interactions

## Performance Optimizations

- Incremental computation of complex cardinality analysis
- Virtualized lists for high-cardinality metrics and attributes
- Web Worker offloading for impact calculations
- Debounced updates for parameter changes
- Progressive loading for detailed analysis

## Example Usage

```tsx
function MetricsAnalysisDashboard({ snapshotId }) {
  const [selectedMetricId, setSelectedMetricId] = useState(null);
  const [costModel, setCostModel] = useState({
    costPerSeries: 0.001,
    costPerDataPoint: 0.0000001,
    retentionPeriodDays: 30,
    scrapeIntervalSeconds: 60
  });
  
  const handleMetricSelect = (metricId) => {
    setSelectedMetricId(metricId);
  };
  
  return (
    <div className="dashboard">
      <ControlPanel onMetricSelect={handleMetricSelect} onCostModelChange={setCostModel} />
      
      <CardinalityAnalysisView
        snapshotId={snapshotId}
        initialMetricId={selectedMetricId}
        costModel={costModel}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Event Handling

The component listens for and emits the following events:

- Listens for `snapshot.loaded` to trigger initial analysis
- Listens for `metric.selected` to focus on a specific metric
- Emits `cardinality.analyzed` when analysis is complete
- Emits `recommendations.generated` when recommendations are ready
- Emits `configuration.exported` when export is requested

## Dependencies

- CardinalityAnalysisEngine: For cardinality calculations and analysis
- RecommendationGenerator: For creating optimization suggestions
- ConfigurationExporter: For creating implementation snippets
- CostEstimator: For calculating resource implications
- VisualizationLibrary: For specialized cardinality visualizations

The Cardinality Analysis View is a powerful tool for understanding and addressing the challenges of high-cardinality metrics, helping users optimize their telemetry for better performance and cost efficiency.
